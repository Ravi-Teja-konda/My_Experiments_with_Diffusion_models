# Experiments with image generation diffusion models
This is repository is a just an simple experiment with multiple image generation diffusion models.

Currently we have experimented with DALL-E-2 furthermore, we will be adding the results and analysis of models 
like stable diffusion, Imagen, mid journey and others here.

## DALL-E-2 
Here in DALL-E in order to generate a high quality realistic image a detailed description of the image we want to generate should be provided.
Basically we call the description as prompt in dall-e, a prompt in DALL-E is limited to 400 words and has the strict censoring to hate, violence, explicit and other content.

For more info on dalle-2 content policy please refer content policy

### Writing good prompt
In order to get better results adding adjectives and keeping it simple helps us.But if we want to generate a specific image adding detailed description to the prompt will give better results. adding the terms like hyper-realstic, high resolution, and lighting , photography style, lens type will give good output.

### Generating images

Here are portrait images generated with DALL-E-2 and tweaked with ARC face restoration AI.
Will be adding more photograhy types like landscapes and others further

Will be adding the prompts of the above images in coming days.

## Stable Diffusion

Stable diffusion is one of the fastest growing open-source model from stability.AI.It is trained on 2.3 English label subset of the CLIP-filtered image-text pairs open dataset LAION 5b.

Along with the prompt stable diffuison also supports to configure the nosie levels, different samplers, number of iterations, guidance level and also a prompt to not generate in our image generation.

Stable diffusion produces 512 * 512 resolution images.


More info image generation results will be added here.
